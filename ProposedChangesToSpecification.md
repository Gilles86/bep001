# Proposed changes to BIDS specification

This document captures all of the changes that the BEP001 team are proposing to the BIDS specification.

Table of contents:

* [Repetition Time](#repetition-time)
* [B1plus fieldmaps](#b1plus-fieldmaps)
* [S0map](#s0map)

## Repetition Time

### Proposed Change

Adjust the definition of `RepetitionTime` in section [4.1.x Task (including resting state) imaging data](https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-specification/blob/master/src/04-modality-specific-files/01-magnetic-resonance-imaging-data.md#task-including-resting-state-imaging-data) and add two new fields to section [4.1.y Anatomy imaging data](https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-specification/blob/master/src/04-modality-specific-files/01-magnetic-resonance-imaging-data.md#anatomy-imaging-data).

### Justification

`RepetitionTime` is currently defined very specifically as relating to functional imaging data.
However there are structural scans that collect multiple volumes during an acquisition.
Here we adjust the definition of `RepetitionTime` in section 4.1.x and add `RepetitionTimeExcitation` and `RepetitionTimePreparation` as two additional terms for structural acquisitions that include multiple contrasts in 4.1.y.

## Repetition Time

### Proposed Change

Extend the part on `Fieldmaps` in [4.1.x Task (including resting state) imaging data](https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-specification/blob/master/src/04-modality-specific-files/01-magnetic-resonance-imaging-data.md#task-including-resting-state-imaging-data) by also allowing
for storing B1+ fielmaps.

### Justification

For some anatomical MRI acquisitions, especially when doing quantiative MRI (qMRI), B1+ fieldmaps can be useful to get better estimates of the underlying physical parameters (e.g., T1 in T1 maps obtained with MP2RAGE-sequence, see Marques et al., 2013).

## S0map

### Proposed Change

Add a suffix `_S0map` to store the intercept-parameter for when T2\*-decay curves are fit, for example using a multi-echo Gradien-Recalled Echo (GRE)-sequence.

### Justification

Both structural and functional multi-echo sequences are becoming more and more common. By fitting an exponential T2\*-model to such data, a `S0-map` remains that contains contrast for proton density (PD) and B1+ and B1--effects. This can be useful for for example skull-stripping.
