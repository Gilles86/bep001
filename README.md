# BEP001

This repository is primarily used for the issues, as a way to project manage ***[BIDS Extension Proposal 001](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QwfHyBzOyFWOLO4u_kkojLpUhW0-4_M7Ubafu9Gf4Gg/edit#heading=h.6e5avk8akeqj): Structural acquisitions that include multiple contrasts***.

## Get in touch

### Google doc

The BEP001 proposal is a [google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QwfHyBzOyFWOLO4u_kkojLpUhW0-4_M7Ubafu9Gf4Gg/edit#heading=h.6e5avk8akeqj) and everyone is welcome (encouraged!) to read it and leave any comments you have. The link should take you to "[suggesting mode](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/6033474?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&hl=en)" which means you can make *suggested* changes to the document. You won't be able to delete everything so the more questions, comments and recommendations the better!

### Branches
This github repo contains multiple branches that are used to work on different aspects of the project:
 * [master](https://github.com/INCF/BEP001/tree/master) This repo contains only content that has been "signed off on" by the community.
 * [repetitiontime](https://github.com/INCF/BEP001/tree/repetitiontime) This repo contains text we want to change in the main BIDS standard about the definition of _RepetitionTime_.
 * [examples](https://github.com/INCF/BEP001/tree/examples) This repo contains some fake datasets that illustrate BEP001 in practice.

### Mailing list

We'll also have a lot of discussion on the [BIDS mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/bids-discussion). Please join and follow along as best you can. If you search the list for [[BEP001]](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!searchin/bids-discussion/%5BBEP001%5D%7Csort:date) you should end up with a nice filtered list of relevant emails.

If you're starting a thread on the BIDS mailing list that is relevant to BEP001 please start the subject line with **[BEP001]** so it is easy to identify for people monitoring the forum and so it shows up in the filtered list above.

When you have a point that you'd like to discuss related to BEP001 please try to **start a new thread** so that we can keep discussions reasonably on track.

### Issues list

The issues at this GitHub repository will be redundant with emails on the BIDS mailing list, but they'll be a persistant track of decisions that have been made (or which are still open and need to be resolved). You're welcome to comment on the threads, but it would be appreciated if your comment was also cross posted on the mailing list or google doc as appropriate.

## Who's involved

This repository is managed by Kirstie Whitaker [@KirstieJane](https://github.com/KirstieJane), but this BIDS extension is lead by Gilles de Hollander. It is a very collaborative project and everyone who takes part will be acknowledged.

We don't have a process for that just yet, if you have any ideas or want to help to record key contributors please add your thoughts to issue [#1](https://github.com/INCF/BEP001/issues/1) :sparkles::space_invader::cake:
